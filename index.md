## Me as a Programmer
I'm still relatively new to my coding journey so I don't have a set idea of what I want to pursue as a career. 

My top choices would have to be:
+ Software Engineer
+ Game Developer
+ Front End Web Developer
+ AI Developer

If I had to rank them on personal preference I would go with this:
1. Game Developer
2. Front End Web Developer
3. Software Engineer
4. AI Developer

I've been playing video games my entire life and its one of my favorite hobbies. I love the creativity and interaction that a video game is able to provide and is a big reason I would like to be a game developer in my future. The game that has really sparked my interest in the field is hollow knight.

As far as the kind of programmer I am, I'd definetely say I prefer to be organized and plan before I start typing. Whenever I start a project, I always make sure to understand what the problem is and how to break it down. Some of these quotes below really encompass my ethic when programming:

**John Johnson:**
> “First solve the problem then write the code.”

**John Romero:**
> “You might not think that programmers are artists, but programming is an extremely creative profession. It’s logic-based creativity.”

**Larry Flon**
> “There is no programming language, no matter how structured, that will prevent programmers from making bad programs.”

As far as my coding knowledge goes, I know C++, Java, and Python the best, with some knowledge of how to use Git. I even used Git in making this page, using commands like:
```
git add
git checkout
git commit -m
git push
```
I still have a lot to learn, especially other programming languages as there are so many, each with its own purpose and benefits over others. I've had a list of languages to learn that I made for myself when I began my prgramming journey. The list fluctuates, but for now it looks something like this:
- [X] Java
- [ ] JavaScript
- [X] Python
- [ ] HTML
- [X] C++
- [ ] C#
- [ ] SQL
- [ ] Git
- [ ] TypeScript

## When I'm not Programming
A _large_ part of my life is my involvement with the D1 Men's Volleyball program here at UCSD. I'm a middle blocker for the team, meaning I'm the one defending the net and leading my team's blocking efforts. On my [roster page](https://ucsdtritons.com/sports/mens-volleyball/roster/jim-garrison/12826) you can see my personal stats and a small biography.

When I'm not doing school work or volleyball, I like to spend my free time with friends and going to the beach, painting, or playing a board game together. I'm not the most extroverted person but I do enjoy my time spent with friends and family.
